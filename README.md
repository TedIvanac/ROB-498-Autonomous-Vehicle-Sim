# Autonomous Vehicle Simulator
This project implements a Kinematic Bicycle Model in MATLAB to autonomously navigate a series of waypoints in along a path generated by an A Star algorithm.

To run the simulator, pull all files from the repository and run main.m

Please read the ROB 498 Autonomous Vehicles Final Project pdf for more information on the code base and project development.
